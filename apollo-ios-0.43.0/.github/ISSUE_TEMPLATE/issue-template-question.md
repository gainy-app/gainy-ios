## Question

Before you ask, check a few things to see if there might already be an answer: 

- [`CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) has all the most recent changes
- We have [extensive documentation available](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ios) (though we're always looking for ways to improve it!)


If neither of those have an answer for you, we've added a [Discussions instance](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/discussions) where our users can ask and answer questions - head on over there rather than opening an issue here please!

## Seriously

Please use [Github Discussions](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/discussions) for questions ðŸ˜‡
