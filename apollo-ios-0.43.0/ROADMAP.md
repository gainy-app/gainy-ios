# Roadmap

This document is meant to give the community some idea of where we're going with the iOS SDK in the short and longer term.

## Short-Term

These are things we plan to be working on **within the next 3 months**.

- **Swift Codegen Rewrite, Continued**: As outlined in much greater detail in the [RFC issue](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/issues/939), we're rewriting our code generation. This has taken ~~somewhat~~ ~~a lot~~ colossally longer than expected, but the following phases are still in progress:
    
    - **Start generating code with Swift instead of Typescript**. This will allow much easier community contribution to code generation, and allow us to take on a bunch of improvements like `Hashable`, `Equatable`, and potentially `Identifiable` without having to fight with Typescript to do it.
    - **Add immutable caching to new generated code**. Caching is currently heavily tied into our existing parsing mechanism. We're going to separate that out in two phases: The first will allow caching that *cannot* be changed by the consumer.
    - **Add mutable caching to new generated code**. This is the final stage of updating caching: Allowing caching that *can* be changed by the consumer.
    - **Remove Old Codegen**. Once all this is built, older codegen will be deprecated. 

    You can follow this effort through the [Swift Codegen GitHub project](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/projects/2).
    
- **Cache Improvements**: We've had a ton of requests for this and we've got some extra muscle now, so we're going to be working on many requests. First up, some features inspired by Apollo Client 3 for the web: 
    - **Better pagination support**. Better support for caching and updating paginated lists of objects. 
    - **Reducing over-normalization**. Only separating out results into individual records when something that can identify them is present
    - **Codable Support**: Which will allow easier moving between any storage method and objects, along with working better with updated codegen.

- **General bug-bashing**: There are always a few outstanding general issues and small feature requests I'd like to address, and we'll be dealing with any new issues as they come up.


## Long-Term

These are things we plan to be working on **beyond the next 3 months**. 

We're very open to any help we can get on these if your goals would be advanced by making these things work better sooner.

- **Moar Cache Stuff**: Some additional improvements to the cache to 
    - **Real cache eviction & dangling reference collection**. There's presently a way to manually remove a value for a given key, but AC3's given us a roadmap for how to handle some of this stuff much more thoroughly and safely. 
    - **Cache metadata**. Ability to add per-field metadata if needed, to allow for TTL and time-based invalidation, along with other possible goodies.

- **Dependency Manager test suite**. We've seen a few issues around things that work well for at least one of the three major iOS dependency managers, but causes problems in others. We plan to make a repo that we can use to automatically test for common issues against new versions of the library on CocoaPods, Carthage, and Swift Package Manager *before* they're released.

- **Wrapper libraries**. A very highly voted suggestion in our fall 2019 developer survey was wrapper libraries for concurrency helpers like RxSwift, Combine, and PromiseKit. 

    Note that we are **not** locked into any particular set of other dependencies to support yet, but we anticipate these will be wrappers in a separate repository that have Apollo as a dependency. As individual wrappers move into nearer-term work, we'll outline which specific ones we'll be supporting.
