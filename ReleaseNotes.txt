Bugfixes

:new: New:
• Ask for app review logic: 1) 3+ favorite TTFs; 2) Portfolio connection; 3) Spent more than 25 minutes in an app
• Surway local notification placeholder (will be filled with data in next build or moved to OneSignal) - starts after app start in 20 seconds
• Migrated to Branch.io for deeplinks

:hammer_and_wrench: Improvements
• Add missing handler for "Unfavorite" button on the discovery screen; hide compare button for now (compare TTFs)
• Fix "TTF opened from the Home tab has the X (close button) over the title. Also, it is always visible if scroll the view."
