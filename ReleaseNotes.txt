KYC + DW

:new: New:
* KYC: Implemented your citizenship screen
* KYC: Implemented new "Investment Profile screen" with all mmissing fields

:hammer_and_wrench: Improvements (mostly technical)
* KYC: Added $500 limit for the "How muh you want to spend" screen
* KYC: Removed "Select Payment Info" for now
* KYC: Update all fonts to match the design (system regular -> SF Display Pro medium)

:red_circle: Important Notes:
If feature is not listed in New or in Improvements - IT’S NOT DONE

:eyes: What to check:
• Check new citizenship screen
• Check new investment profile screen
• Check if payment method screen is removed
• Check $500 limit is working (first KYC screen)
• Check fonts (most regular should become medium)
• Note: KYC form should be sent successfully in the end (if not sent yet for your profile - probably need clenup the form on backend to test it multiple times)
